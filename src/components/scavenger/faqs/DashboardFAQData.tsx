    question: "How do I request Scavenger Hunt related assistance?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Ensure that you have updated your discord handle at the top of the page
        for faster assistance.
        <br />
        <br /> Support for Scavenger Hunt is available through the
        &apos;#scavenger-hunt-support&apos; forum/channel on the official
        Discord server for 2026. <br />
        <br />
        If you require further assistance, you can reach out to organizers at
        the conference, particularly at the Main Hall prize booth, at scheduled
        times. The exact timings will be pinned in `#scavenger-hunt-chat` on the
        official Discord server.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I find organizers or prize booths during the event?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Prize booths will be present in the Main Lobby for several hours on each
        day of the conference. Physical prizes can only be claimed from the Main
        Hall prize booth at scheduled times. The exact timings will be pinned in
        `#scavenger-hunt-chat` on the official Discord server.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim hunt items at any time during the conference?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No. Each hunt item can only be claimed during specific time windows,
        usually around the time that it is revealed at events/present in the
        venue. So make sure claim them right away!
        <br /> <br />
        To prevent unfair advantages and sharing of codes, there are also limits
        on max claims and extensive monitoring of claim attempts. You
        aren&apos;t allowed to share hunt item codes with others.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "The points for hunt items are very low, will I be able to claim any prizes?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes! While individual hunt items may have low point values, we&apos;ve
        attempted to create a fun point-based economy where an average attendee
        visiting majority of the events will be able to claim most of the prizes
        they desire.
        <br /> <br />
        Additionally, some hunt items are worth more points than others. Early
        events and certain sessions may have higher-value items to reward active
        participants.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between hunt items, shop prizes and collectibles?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Hunt items are specific codes or QR codes that you can find and claim.
        These reward you with points that contribute to your overall score in
        the Scavenger Hunt. You can use these points to redeem shop prizes.
        <br /> <br />
        Shop prizes are items that you can redeem using the points you earn from
        claiming hunt items. They are usually physical prizes available at
        designated prize booths during the conference.
        <br /> <br />
        Collectibles are special items that you can find during the hunt. They
        do not contribute to your points but are unique items. You may find a
        collectible when scanning/claiming a hunt item. Certain collectibles
        will also be present in the shop for a brief period of time. Each
        collectible is different, but some can be &apos;used&apos; at the prize
        booth for the specified reward.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "How does the leaderboard work? Will my rank change if I redeem prizes?",
    answer: (
      <>
        The leaderboard ranks participants based on the total points a user has
        accumulated through claiming hunt items.
        <br /> <br />
        Redeeming prizes does not affect your rank on the leaderboard. So feel
        free to use your points to claim prizes & other items from the shop
        without worrying about losing your position!
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I see the hunt items that I have claimed?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Once you claim a hunt item, it will be added to your inventory on your
        dashboard. You can view all the hunt items you have claimed along with
        their details and point values in the inventory section of your
        dashboard.
        <br /> <br />
        The inventory also displays any collectibles and shop prizes you have
        found/redeemed during the hunt.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "I see items in the shop that I cannot redeem/purchase. Why is that?",
    answer: (
      <>
        The shop acts as a catalog for all prizes & collectibles available at
        any given time.
        <br /> <br />
        The shop prizes present in the shop need to be redeemed in-person at the
        prize booths during scheduled times at the conference.
        <br /> <br />
        Some collectibles may be available for a limited time in the shop. These
        can be redeemed by the user directly on the platform. They will then see
        the collectible in their inventory.
