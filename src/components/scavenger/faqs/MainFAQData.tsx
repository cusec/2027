        The Scavenger Hunt is open all attendees of CUSEC 2026. To be able to
        scan/claim hunt items, you&apos;ll need to connect your account with the

    question: "What are hunt items and how do I claim them?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Hunt items are QR codes or specific identifiers/codes that participants
        can find and claim during the Scavenger Hunt. To claim an item, you can
        either scan the QR code (from the Scavenger Hunt page or from your
        device&apos;s camera) or manually enter the code associated with the
        item.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once claimed, the item will be added to your dashboard&apos;s inventory
        and you will notice an increase in your overall points.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hunt items can be found throughout the conference, at various booths,
        events, etc. so keep an eye out and attend the sessions!

        Hunt. The points you accumulate can help you climb the leaderboard and
